Usage
You can use the forms in this project in various ways, depending on your needs. Below are examples and instructions.

Example Forms
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a simple form:

html
Copy code
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Validation Rules
Required Fields: Any field with the required attribute must be filled out before submission.
Email Validation: The email field will check if the input is a valid email format (e.g., name@example.com).
Custom Rules: If you need to add custom validation, you can extend the validation logic with your own rules.
Example of custom validation (in JavaScript):

javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('myForm').onsubmit = function() {
  let name = document.getElementById('name').value;
  if (name.length < 3) {
    alert('Name must be at least 3 characters long');
    return false; // Prevent form submission
  }
};
